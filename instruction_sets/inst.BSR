Branch Sub-Routine
SP $\leftarrow$ SP $-$ 2, STACK $\leftarrow$ PC $+$ len(V), PC $\leftarrow$ PC $+$ V

This instruction branches to the indicated address, saving
the address of the following instruction on the stack, so that
the routine can be returned from using an RTS instruction.

This instruction is helpful for using relocatable code, as it
provides a relative-addressed alternative to JSR.
